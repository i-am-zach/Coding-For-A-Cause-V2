Hello! I'm Cole Gawin! Ever since I learned what an "HTML" was, I have worked on websites and mobile apps for local businesses and non-profits. You can find me online working on open-source software projects, or writing articles for [my programming blog](https://blog.colegaw.in) and some publications [on Medium](https://medium.com/@colegawin). I am super excited to work with the Coding for a Cause team to help make a difference in our community!
