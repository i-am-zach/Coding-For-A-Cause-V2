Hello! I'm Apollos Burcham! I've had a long time passion for website development starting in 6th grade when I built my first barebones HTML and CSS webpage for a school project. I co-founded this club in order to nurture non-profit organizations in our community whilst simultaneously teaching students the fundamentals of web development, web design, and deployment.
