Hello! I'm Zach Lefkovitz! I was inspired to found Coding for a Cause after working on a project with the Deerfield Parent Network. I wanted people in my community to always have a resource that they could go to for assistance on technical related issues that can be resolved by students who are eager to find their footing in a Computer Science industry.
