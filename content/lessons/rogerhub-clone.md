Hello Everyone!

For the past quarter, we have been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now comes the time to put it all together. In our next meeting after school on Friday the 13th (spooky), we will make a final grade calculator together. This final grade calculator will be an awesome addition to anyone's portfolio as it demonstrates a good understanding of scaffolding a design, implementing the design with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript. This is another meeting that I wouldn't want to miss.
